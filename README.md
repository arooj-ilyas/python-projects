## The Number Guessing Game revolves around a few key elements:

1. Generating a Random Number: The game will randomly generate a number between 1 and 10, which you will have to guess.
2. User Interaction: You will be asked to enter your name, making the game more personalized. Then, you can begin guessing the number.
3. Feedback Loop: After each guess, the game will provide feedback on whether your guess is too low or too high. This will guide you in making your subsequent guesses.
4. Limited Attempts: You will have a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the correct number. Can you solve the mystery within these attempts?
5. Victory or Defeat: If you successfully guess the number within the given attempts, you will be celebrated for your guessing prowess. If not, the game will reveal the correct number.

## How the Game Works

1. Upon starting the game, a random number between 1 and 10 is generated using random.randint(1, 10).
2. You will be asked to enter your name, making the game more personalized and engaging.
3. The game will prompt you to make a guess, and it will provide feedback based on your guess - whether it's too low or too high.
4. You have 5 attempts to guess the correct number. Can you crack the code within these attempts?
5. If you guess the number correctly, the game will congratulate you and display the number of attempts it took. If not, the game will reveal the correct number.
